# Programming with Multiple Files

RAV programming is functional only, though large projects still require multiple files. To include these files in the main file, use the `import` keyword.

```
import math.rav

int x = sqrt.call(16);
print.call(x);
```

**NOTE:** execution starts from main() in the designated source file.
