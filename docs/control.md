# Keywords, Statements, Control Structures, etc

RAV includes all standard loops, conditional statements, and control keywords.

### Conditional Statements

For conditional programming, use the keyword `if`. `else` may be needed as well.

```
if (x % 2 == 0) {
	print.call("x is even.");
} else {
	print.call("x is odd.");
}
```

### Loops

For loops, use the `while` keyword.

```
int i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
	print.call(i);
	i += 1;
}
```
