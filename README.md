# RAV

Interpreter for the RAV language.

### RAV is an interpreted yet statically-typed language that is fit for a wide variety of efficient and productive tasks.

---

RAV was made as a hobby and demo project. It has consistent and intuitive syntax that imitates its powerful engine.

```
import stdlib/sys.rav

fn main() {
	string msg = "Hello world!";
	print.call(msg);
}
```

The RAV interpreter is written in Ruby. Learn about language specifications in `docs/`.
