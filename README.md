# RAV
Virtual compiler for the RAV language
### RAV is a compiled and statically-typed language that is fit for a wide variety of efficient and productive tasks.
---
RAV stands for Revamped Assembly Language. It has consistent and intuitive syntax that imitates its powerful engine.
```
import stdlib/sys.rav

fn main() {
	string msg = "Hello world!";
	print.call(msg);
}
```
The RAV compiler uses the main.rav file as the source code, compiling it down to virtual machine instructions and executing them on its own virtual machine.
